# INFO
Set of quickbms scripts to manage and modify files from various games.

Hi, on this repository you will find a collection of tools and scripts written by me or/and my colleagues. 

Languages used here are mostly c, c++, c# and MexScript/QuickBms.

There is no need to compile my scripts to run them, BUT they require interpreters to run properly e.g. quickBMS.
You can download this wonderful tool here: http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip

Feel free to use my tools/scripts for your game modding projects.

If you have any questions, you can raise an issue on Github or ask on Zenhax forum.

Regards.
